The names of the folders should not mislead you. The cursor image sizes can be changed. The maximum seems to be 128px (square).

So, you can use the five different cursors as whatever size you wish. There isn't a restriction on the sizing except what the browser will allow.

Feel free to change them up, and draw them for yourself, just keep those file names the same as they are.
