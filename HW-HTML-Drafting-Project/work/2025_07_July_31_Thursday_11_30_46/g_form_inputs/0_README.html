<h1>Usage notes for the scripts found in this directory.</h1>

<h2>.preceding_directory</h2>
<p>This is a file used only by the 'revert' script. It stores the name of the preceding directory. This allows reversion to happen. It is best not to alter this file.</p>

<h2>Rough Work for the graphical interface</h2>
<p>Here you will find some of the part that I used to make the 'self-assembled' user interface. I started making it in the same way that you will probably start too. Just make up some little HTML programs and then just drag them into a part in the HTML Drafting Program. Later I would just copy the parts into the correct code location so that it would become accessible by clicking it in the program. A lot of what is here was then, in sequence, eliminated as I added functionality to the program. For example: 'drag-edges'... Once you have that available with the mouse, there isn't really any reason to use a graphical button for it, unless for the purpose of grid alignment. (that's the only advantage left)</p>
