Assalamu Alaikum,

This is a good point to start up a 'contributor' logfile on this project. This way each contributor could potentially log what will become public notes on what their motivation is, at any time. This can help to establish a feeling of their interest in advancing the project. Maybe declaring a personal bent on project direction. So, here's mine:

I am looking towards bringing together some type of graphical button interface that will be placed within its own 'div'. The UI will be an overlay, and it will not effect the placement of anything in the current setup. The purpose of the UI will be to give a sort of menu of functions, perhaps grouping some together. Mostly this will be a direct duplication of what is found on the keyboard. There will also be some extension to what functionality is available at the keyboard, if it is possible to do so.

The general direction is to break up some of the UI functionality into groups of 'widgets' and 'wizards'. Certain of these will exceed the capability and accuracy of what is available in the tuners. This will be owing to the fact that there are only so many keys.

Keys are fast, true. But, there are some tasks or arrangements which are difficult to accomplish through the keyboard alone. This is where the 'wizards' will come into play, making otherwise difficult tasks seem much easier.

This will be my #1 task in this HW HTML Drafting Project.

An allotment has been made for the UI, and now some type of brief design work should have the UI come up at the top left or centre? This is a big decision... let's go top left for now. Maybe two rows across the top? Low-res png icons?

An allotment has been made for the first attempt at a UI. I have mocked-up a 25 tile format which will appear in the top left corner of the viewport when the 'TAB' key is pressed. I will now proceed to draw up the 'wizards'/'widgets' which the buttons will bring into the program. The wizards will be various in nature but, most of the work is already done in the foundation of the program. I will almost exclusively rely on functions that have already been written. I will simply call up those functions through a clickable UI button. The buttons will actually be inside of the same package as all other parts which you can enter into the program.

That is an important point: The UI buttons are actually not different from any other object that the program deals with. Yes, I am preparing them in advance but, they should correctly be viewed as an example of how the clickable interface of the program may be extended further. In-Shallah this will be seen as a strong example, and not only as a completely finished and usable product.

If we consider the usability of the program before the clickable UI is made, and before. Some users might see it as being impossible to use before, and after will see that it is so good that it is impossible not to use. So, we must keep in mind that all of the foundational ideas, concepts, and program functions did actually make up the main bit of the true 'development' of this project.

Now we will test the strength of the concepts that informed the foundational aspects, and come to know the depth of consideration necessary for that development.

The click interface seems to be getting along quite well, and I have now completed the first five. In-Shallah I will complete more, and this project will become further advanced.

Well, it looks like I have made my way through some of these little 'click-interface' buttons. I am sure that some other person, who is an HTML/Javascript/CSS expert will have better ideas than I have. These are really only designed to be an example, and just to get this project started.

In-Shallah, this will help people to use the program, and make it easier, and more enjoyable.
