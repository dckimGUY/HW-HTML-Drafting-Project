HTML Drafting Project

The foundational components of this project are in place and now, the next steps will be to develop branches that are distinct but, thoughtfully developed.

Clearly the project should not be pigeon-holed. The subject of HTML and it's usages are intentionally broad, and I believe that its value could even extend to daily use for non-experts. If only there was a facilitation in that direction.

The present project foundation is extensive, and has been left open for possibilities, and to accomodate the widest range of potential use cases.

I will endeavour to offer a description here.

The basic selection and focus system is completely integrated with a tripartite selection system based on what group the currently focused item is part of. Each item is a member of one and only one group. This allows functions to be applied more broadly, extending to groups.

A fairly obvious inclusion in the program is that dragging files in from the file system is allowed. This is not particularly interesting or unique.

What is more interesting and unique is the system in place which allows 'textually dragging' style or other attribute information from one part onto another, thus effecting the application of that information to the receptor. This feels like a very strong general foundation for a templating system. Each part can become a template via a selection of any of it's information. The example of a size and location template is fairly easy to see the advantages of, though other combinations may be as valuable but less obvious.

The way forward for the project as a whole is fairly clear: Potential branches must be considered carefully. The foundation of the project will be improved in a manner informed by hypothetical potential branches. Considerations will be made in a 'back-and-forth' manner until the optimal branch selections are made clear. At the appropriate and correct time, the foundation must be clarified and solidified in preparation for accomodating the branch candidates.

A common general set will be identified, and perhaps this initial foundation will be expanded or restricted thoughtfully allowing a clean separation, with overlap handled in the foundation. The foundation will represent the overlap of all branches.

In the earliest stage of branch design, the most crucial decisions are made, and can have a lasting effect on the project goind forward.

Even a decision being as simple as the number of branches could be crucial.

Too many will result in 'over-specialization'.

I could see between three to five but, 
it's open source, I can't stop you.
